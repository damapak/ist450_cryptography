# TIMELINE:  2017

1. March 14:  Windows releases security patch MS17-010
      
2. April 14:  Shadowbrokers (active since Summer 2016) releases New batch of NSA software exploits, including:
      * ETERNALBLUE – remote execution exploit for Server Message Block (SMB)
      * DOUBLEPULSAR – persistent backdoor used to install/execute code (kernel ring 0)
      
3. May 12:
      * WannaCry (WannaDecrypt) attack begins
      * Over 230,000 devices infected in more than 150 countries
      * Marcus Hutchins (aka MalwareTech) registers the domain name found in the kill switch, largely ending the spread of the malware
      
4. May 19:  DDOS using Mirai botnet to attack the kill-switch domain.  In response, Marcus Hutchins enabled caching on the domain to keep it available.

5. December 20:  US officially announces North Korea carried out the attack

# WHAT DID IT DO?
* Encrypted disk drives
* Demanded ransom in bitcoin to decrypt files (~$300)

# HOW DID IT WORK?
* Used ETERNALBLUE to exploit SMB and access devices
* Once compromised with ETERNALBLUE, installed DOUBLEPULSAR to deliver the payload (if DOUBLEPULSAR already installed, used existing install to execute code)
* Attempts to connect to kill switch domain
  * If found, stops execution of code
  * If not found, proceeds with code execution
* Begins encrypting all available disk drives (including network shares, USB, etc.)
* Does the following simultaneously to propagate itself:
  * Checks IP address of infected machine and attempts to use port 445 to connect to all IP addresses in the same subnet
  * Attempts to use port 445 to connect to a random IP address
* Installs DOUBLEPULSAR for all successful connections
* After encryption complete, displays ransom note

# SOLUTIONS
* Patch/upgrade systems (MS17-010; Windows 10 was not vulnerable at the time)
* Disable SMB (block incoming traffic to ports 139, 445)
* Register the kill switch domain (kill switch included to detect sandboxing and prevent analysis); Domain was hardcoded, meaning once the domain was registered the malware could not infect any new machines
* Get the RSA keys to decrypt (exploit windows implementation of RSA key generation)
  * [github.com/aguinet/wannakey](https://github.com/aguinet/wannakey)
  * Prior to windows 10, CryptDestroyKey and CryptReleaseContext did not erase the prime factors from memory before freeing the associated memory
  * As long as the keys are still in memory, can get them and get the key to decrypt the files

# IMPACT
* 300,000+ devices infected
* Shut down some hospitals, manufacturing plants; also affected FedEx, Telefonica
* Hundreds of millions to billions of $ in damages
* As of June 14, 2017, 327 payments totaling $130,634.77 had been transferred to the bitcoin address
* Apparently state-sponsored:  Attributed to North Korea
* Researcher who registered the kill switch domain was arrested a few months later – after Def Con 2017, in August (on unrelated charges of writing Kronos banking malware); case is ongoing
* Many blame the NSA, as they:
  * Developed the exploits used by the attack
  * Did not disclose the exploits until after they had been released into the wild
* Follow-up attacks:
  * NotPetya (Ukraine)
  * EternalRocks (used ETERNALBLUE & DOUBLEPULSAR, plus 5 other NSA exploits)
